  "I have a passion for music, art, nature, and building functionally beautiful web applications. I'm a front-end UI developer with experience in JavaScript, JavaScript libraries such as Vue.js and React, HTML 5, CSS, CSS preprocessors SASS and LESS, and CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind. I love to learn and utilize new tools and frameworks and I'm presently excited to see how I can work with AI tools to push my development work further.<br /><br />At TransUnion I worked on a development team that owned the company\'s regulatory sites. The team built out the site to parity with an existing site and then further developed it to include many new features. As a senior developer I mentored the junior developers and would provide them with development direction as needed and would work with UI/UX, product owners, and technical owners to get them unblocked. Also while at TransUnion on worked on building out the credit report components for the organization\'s branded sites. Prior to my time at TransUnion I worked at PMI as a frontend developer working on building out components for the Sitecore CMS the company used and I also worked on building out the UI for the company\'s other .Net applications.",

For the dispute flow I worked on the UI/UX design in Sketch with the UI/UX team and worked with the development team to build out the UI using HTML, SASS, JavaScript, Handlebars, and Java. The dispute flow consists of a report pull, displaying the users entire disclosure report, allowing the user to select items to dispute and the reason(s) why the user believes the data is incorrect, and lastly submitting that request to the dispute service which then gets sent out to the creditors whose data is in question. The modernized dispute flow increased the success rate of users being able to submit their request by 30%."

For this I worked on the UI/UX designs in Sketch with the UI/UX team and also worked with the development team and architecture to build out the functionality using HTML, JavaScript, SASS, Handlebars, and Java. The document upload has limitations that come from what the creditors will accept, those being that users can only upload five documents, there is a limit to the file type of documents that are allowed, and there is also a file size limitation. The UI needs to check for these things before the documents are uploaded to the file receiver and document information needs to be displayed back to the user on the dispute summary page. Users also need to be able to delete documents once uploaded which the UI needs to communicate to the file service to remove those files. Once the dispute with files is submitted the files are then sent to the dispute service and from there move along to the creditors whose data was included in the dispute."
